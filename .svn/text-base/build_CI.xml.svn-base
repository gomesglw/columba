        This is the Columba Continous Integration build file. It depends on an installed version of
        install4j (http://www.ej-technologies.com/products/install4j/overview.html)
        in path /opt/install4j.
        
        It makes use of the existing build.xml file for creating a columba.jar archive and
        on build_install4j.xml to create the release packages.
        Note that the version information passed as commandline argument is applied
        to the sourcecode and also to the names of the release packages.
        
        Quickstart:
         ant -f build_CI.xml build
         
         This will generate release packages and uses the current time as filenames.
         
        Example:
         ant -Dversion=1.4 -f build_CI.xml build

		 This will use the given version number as filename. 
		 
        Have fun ... your Columba Team!
